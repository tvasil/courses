    "- Probabilities must sum up to 1\n",
    "- The complement of an event, Ac, means that the event does not happen\n",

    "**Odds**\n",
    "- The odds for event A, denoted O(A) is defined as O(A) = P(A)/P(Ac) = P(A)/(1 − P(A)).\n",
    "- This can also be expressed as 1:5 (or 5:1 “odds against”). Thus, an event with probability 3/10 has 3:7 odds (7:3 odds against) and an event with probability 4/5 has 4:1 odds.\n",
